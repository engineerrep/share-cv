    <p>
      1.1 Data You Provide To Us

    </p>
    <p>
      Registration

    </p>
    <p>
      To create an account you need to provide data including your name, email address and/or mobile number, and a
      password. If you register for a premium Service, you will need to provide payment (e.g., credit card) and billing
      information.

    </p>
    <p>
      Profile
    </p>
    <p>

      You have choices about the information on your profile, such as your education, work experience, skills, photo,
      city or area and endorsements. You don’t have to provide additional information on your profile; however, profile
      information helps you to get more from our Services, including helping recruiters and business opportunities find
      you. It’s your choice whether to include sensitive information on your profile and to make that sensitive
      information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be publicly
      available.

    </p>
    <p> Posting and Uploading</p>
    <p>
      We collect personal data from you when you provide, post or upload it to our Services, such as when you fill out a
      form, (e.g., with demographic data or salary), respond to a survey, or submit a resume or fill out a job
      application on our Services. If you opt to import your address book, we receive your contacts (including contact
      information your service provider(s) or app automatically added to your address book when you communicated with
      addresses or numbers not already in your list).

    </p>
    <p>
      If you sync your contacts or calendars with our Services, we will collect your address book and calendar meeting
      information to keep growing your network by suggesting connections for you and others, and by providing
      information about events, e.g. times, places, attendees and contacts.

    </p>
    <p>
      You don’t have to post or upload personal data; though if you don’t, it may limit your ability to grow and engage
      with your network over our Services.

    </p>
    <p>
      You and others may post content that includes information about you (as part of articles, posts, comments, videos)
      on our Services. We also may collect public information about you, such as professional-related news and
      accomplishments, and make it available as part of our Services, including, as permitted by your settings, in

      messages using our Services (including invites or connection requests). If you or others opt-in to sync email
      accounts with our Services, we will also collect “email header” information that we can associate with Member
      profiles.

    </p>
    <p>
      Partners
    </p>
    <p>
      We receive personal data (e.g., your job title and work email address) about you when you use the services of our
      customers and partners, such as employers or prospective employers and applicant tracking systems providing us job
      application data.

    </p>
    <p>
      Related Companies and Other Services

    </p>
    <p>
      We receive data about you when you use some of the other services provided by us or our affiliates, including

      such as Outlook, for improved professional networking activities on our Services

      1.3 Service Use

    <p>
      We log usage data when you visit or otherwise use our Services, including our sites, app and platform technology,
      such as when you view or click on content (e.g., learning video) or ads (on or off our sites and apps), perform a
      search, install or update one of our mobile apps, share articles or apply for jobs. We use log-ins, cookies,
      device information and internet protocol (“IP”) addresses to identify you and log your use.

    </p>
    <p>
      1.4 Cookies and Similar Technologies
    </p>
    <p>
      As further described in our Cookie Policy, we use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., pixels and ad tags) to
      collect data (e.g., device IDs) to recognize you and your device(s) on, off and across different services and
      devices where you have engaged with our Services. We also allow some others to use cookies as described in our
      Cookie Policy. If you are outside the Designated Countries, we also collect (or rely on others who collect)
      information about your device where you have not engaged with our Services (e.g., ad ID, IP address, operating
      system and browser information) so we can provide our Members with relevant ads and better understand their
      effectiveness. Learn more. You can opt out from our use of data from cookies and similar technologies that track
      your behavior on the sites of others for ad targeting and other ad-related purposes. For Visitors, the controls
      are here.

    </p>

    <p>
      1.5 Your Device and Location

    </p>

    <p>
      When you visit or leave our Services (including some plugins and our cookies or similar technology on the sites of
      others), we receive the URL of both the site you came from and the one you go to and the time of your visit. We
      also get information about your network and device (e.g., IP address, proxy server, operating system, web browser
      and add-ons, device identifier and features, cookie IDs and/or ISP, or your mobile carrier). If you use our
      Services from a mobile device, that device will send us data about your location based on your phone settings. We
      will ask you to opt-in before we use GPS or other tools to identify your precise location.

    </p>

    <p>
      1.6 Workplace and School Provided Information

    </p>

    <p>
      Others buying our Services for your use, such as your employer or your school, provide us with personal data about
      you and your eligibility to use the Services that they purchase for use by their workers, students or alumni. For
      example, we will get contact information for “Company Page” administrators and for authorizing users of our
      premium Services, such as our recruiting, sales or learning products.

    </p>

    <p>
      1.7 Sites and Services of Others

    </p>
    <p>
      We receive information about your visits and interaction with services provided by others when you log-in with
      Share-CV or visit others’ services that include some of our plugins (such as “Apply with Share-CV”) or our ads,
      cookies or similar technologies.

    </p>
    <p>1.8 Other</p>
    <p>
      Our Services are dynamic, and we often introduce new features, which may require the collection of new
      information. If we collect materially different personal data or materially change how we collect, use or share
      your data, we will notify you and may also modify this Privacy Policy.

    </p>
    <p> 2. How We Use Your Data</p>
    <p>
      How we use your personal data will depend on which Services you use, how you use those Services and the choices
      you make in your settings. We use the data that we have about you to provide and personalize our Services,
      including with the help of automated systems and inferences we make, so that our Services (including ads) can be
      more relevant and useful to you and others.

    </p>
    <p>
      2.1 Services
    </p>
    <p>
      We use your data to authorize access to our Services and honor your settings.

    </p>
    <p>Stay Connected</p>
    <p>
      Our Services allow you to stay in touch and up to date with colleagues, partners, clients, and other professional
      contacts. To do so, you can “connect” with the professionals who you choose, and who also wish to “connect” with
      you. Subject to your and their settings, when you connect with other Members, you will be able to search each
      others’ connections in order to exchange professional opportunities.

    </p>
    <p>
      We use data about you (such as your profile, profiles you have viewed or data provided through address book
      uploads or partner integrations) to help others find your profile, suggest connections for you and others (e.g.
      Members who share your contacts or job experiences) and enable you to invite others to become a Member and connect
      with you. You can also opt-in to allow us to use your precise location or proximity to others for certain tasks
      (e.g. to suggest other nearby Members for you to connect with, calculate the commute to a new job, or notify your
      connections that you are at a professional event).

    </p>
    <p>
      It is your choice whether to invite someone to our Services, send a connection request, or allow another Member to
      become your connection. When you invite someone to connect with you, your invitation will include your network and
      basic profile information (e.g., name, profile photo, job title, region). We will send invitation reminders to the
      person you invited. You can choose whether or not to share your own list of connections with your connections.

    </p>
    <p>
      Visitors have choices about how we use their data.

    </p>
    <p>Stay Informed</p>
    <p>
      Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas regarding professional topics you care about,
      and from professionals you respect. Our Services also allow you to improve your professional skills, or learn new
      ones. We use the data we have about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from your engagement with our
      Services and inferences we make from the data we have about you), to personalize our Services for you, such as by
      recommending or ranking relevant content and conversations on our Services. We also use the data we have about you
      to suggest skills you could add to your profile and skills that you might need to pursue your next opportunity.
      So, if you let us know that you are interested in a new skill (e.g., by watching a learning video), we will use
      this information to personalize content in your feed, suggest that you follow certain members on our site, or
      suggest related learning content to help you towards that new skill. We use your content, activity and other data,
      including your name and photo, to provide notices to your network and others. For example, subject to your
      settings, we may notify others that you have updated your profile, posted content, took a social action, used a
      feature, made new connections or were mentioned in the news.

    </p>
    <p>Career</p>

    <p>
      Our Services allow you to explore careers, evaluate educational opportunities, and seek out, and be found for,
      career opportunities. Your profile can be found by those looking to hire (for a job or a specific task) or be
      hired by you. We will use your data to recommend jobs or mentees, show you and others relevant professional
      contacts (e.g., who work at a company, in an industry, function or location or have certain skills and
      connections). You can signal that you are interested in changing jobs and share information with recruiters. We
      will use your data to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters. We may use automated systems to provide content
      and recommendations to help make our Services more relevant to our Members, Visitors and customers. Keeping your
      profile accurate and up-to-date may help you better connect to others and to opportunities through our Services.

    </p>
    <p> Productivity</p>
    <p>
      Our Services allow you to collaborate with colleagues, search for potential clients, customers, partners and
      others to do business with. Our Services allow you to communicate with other Members and schedule and prepare
      meetings with them. If your settings allow, we scan messages to provide “bots” or similar tools that facilitate
      tasks such as scheduling meetings, drafting responses, summarizing messages or recommending next steps. Learn
      more.

    </p>
    <p>2.2 Marketing</p>
    <p>
      In addition to advertising our Services, we use Members’ data and content for invitations and communications
      promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services, such as by showing your connections that you
      have used a feature on our Services.

    </p>
    <p> 2.3 Developing Services and Research</p>
    <p>
      Service Development
    </p>
    <p>
      We use data, including public feedback, to conduct research and development for our Services in order to provide
      you and others with a better, more intuitive and personalized experience, drive membership growth and engagement
      on our Services, and help connect professionals to each other and to economic opportunity.

    </p>
    <p>
      Other Research

    </p>
    <p>
      We seek to create economic opportunity for Members of the global workforce and to help them be more productive and
      successful. We use the personal data available to us to research social, economic and workplace trends, such as
      jobs availability and skills needed for these jobs and policies that help bridge the gap in various industries and
      geographic areas. In some cases, we work with trusted third parties to perform this research, under controls that
      are designed to protect your privacy. We publish or allow others to publish economic insights, presented as
      aggregated data rather than personal data.

    </p>


    <p>
      Surveys

    </p>
    <p>
      Polls and surveys are conducted by us and others through our Services. You are not obligated to respond to polls
      or surveys, and you have choices about the information you provide. You may opt-out of survey invitations.

    </p>

    <p>
      2.4 Customer Support

    </p>

    <p>
      We use data (which can include your communications) to investigate, respond to and resolve complaints and for
      Service issues (e.g., bugs).

    </p>

    <p>
      2.5 Insights That Do Not Identify You

    </p>
    <p>
      We use your data to produce and share insights that do not identify you. For example, we may use your data to
      generate statistics about our members, their profession or industry, to calculate ad impressions served or clicked
      on, or to publish visitor demographics for a Service or create demographic workforce insights.

    </p>
    <p> 2.6 Security and Investigations</p>
    <p>
      We use your data (including your communications) for security purposes or to prevent or investigate possible fraud
      or other violations of our User Agreement and/or attempts to harm our Members, Visitors or others.

    </p>

    <p>
      3. How We Share Information
    </p>
    <p> 3.1 Our Services</p>
    <p>Profile</p>
    <p>
      Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your settings, it can also
      be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third- party search
      engines). As detailed in our Help Center, your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the
      subscriptions they may have, their usage of our Services, access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by
      keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile.

    </p>

    <p>
      4. Your Choices & Obligations

    </p>


    <p>
      4.1 Data Retention

    </p>
    <p>
      We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services.
      This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even
      if you only use our Services when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep
      your profile open, unless you close your account. In some cases we choose to retain certain information (e.g.,
      insights about Services use) in a depersonalized or aggregated form.

    </p>

    <p>
      4.2 Rights to Access and Control Your Personal Data

    </p>
    <p>
      We provide many choices about the collection, use and sharing of your data, from deleting or correcting data you
      include in your profile and controlling the visibility of your posts to advertising opt-outs and communication
      controls. We offer you settings to control and manage the personal data we have about you.

    </p>
    <p>
      For personal data that we have about you, you can:

    </p>
    <p>
      Delete Data: You can ask us to erase or delete all or some of your personal data (e.g., if it is no longer
      necessary to provide Services to you).

    </p>

    <p>
      Change or Correct Data: You can edit some of your personal data through your account. You can also ask us to
      change, update or fix your data in certain cases, particularly if it’s inaccurate.

    </p>
    <p>
      Object to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Data: You can ask us to stop using all or some of your personal data
      (e.g., if we have no legal right to keep using it) or to limit our use of it (e.g., if your personal data is
      inaccurate or unlawfully held).

    </p>

    <p>
      Right to Access and/or Take Your Data: You can ask us for a copy of your personal data and can ask for a copy of
      personal data you provided in machine readable form.

    </p>
    <p>
      Visitors can learn more about how to make these requests here. You may also contact us using the contact
      information below, and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws.

    </p>

    <p>
      Residents in the Designated Countries and other regions may have additional rights under their laws.

    </p>
    <p>
      4.3 Account Closure

    </p>

    <p>
      If you choose to close your Share-CV account, your personal data will generally stop being visible to others on
      our Services within 24 hours. We generally delete closed account information within 30 days of account closure,
      except as noted below.

    </p>
    <p>
      We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our
      legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain
      security, prevent fraud and abuse (e.g., if we have restricted your account for breach of our Professional
      Community Policies), enforce our User Agreement, or fulfill your request to "unsubscribe" from further messages
      from us. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed.

    </p>

    <p>
      Information you have shared with others (e.g., through InMail, updates or group posts) will remain visible after
      you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that
      other Members have copied out of our Services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed
      accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of
      others (e.g., search engine results) until they refresh their cache.

    </p>
    <p>
      5. Other Important Information

    </p>
    <p>
      5.1. Security

    </p>

    <p>
      We implement security safeguards designed to protect your data, such as HTTPS. We regularly monitor our systems
      for possible vulnerabilities and attacks. However, we cannot warrant the security of any information that you send
      us. There is no guarantee that data may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our
      physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. Please visit our Safety Center for additional information about
      safely using our Services, including two-factor authentication.

    </p>

    <p>
      5.2. Cross-Border Data Transfers

    </p>
    <p>
      We process data both inside and outside of the United States and rely on legally-provided mechanisms to lawfully
      transfer data across borders. Learn more. Countries where we process data may have laws which are different from,
      and potentially not as protective as, the laws of your own country.

    </p>

    <p>
      5.3 Lawful Bases for Processing

    </p>
    <p>
      We will only collect and process personal data about you where we have lawful bases. Lawful bases include
      consent(where you have given consent), contract (where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract
      with you (e.g., to deliver the Share-CV Services you have requested) and “legitimate interests.” Learn more.

    </p>
    <p>
      Where we rely on your consent to process personal data, you have the right to withdraw or decline your consent at
      any time and where we rely on legitimate interests, you have the right to object. Learn More. If you have any
      questions about the lawful bases upon which we collect and use your personal data, please contact our Data
      Protection Officer here.

    </p>

    <p>
      5.4. Direct Marketing and Do Not Track Signals

    </p>
    <p>
      We currently do not share personal data with third parties for their direct marketing purposes without your
      permission. Learn more about this and about our response to “do not track” signals.

    </p>
    <p>
