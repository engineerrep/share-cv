    <p>
      At share-cv, we believe in being clear and open about how we collect and use data related to you. This Cookie
      Policy applies to any share-cv product or service that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference. We
      use cookies and similar technologies such as pixels, local storage and mobile ad IDs (collectively referred to in
      this policy as “cookies”) to collect and use data as part of our Services, as defined in our Privacy Policy
      (“Services”) and which includes our sites, communications, mobile applications and off-site Services, such as our
      ad services and the “Apply with share-cv” and “Share with share-cv” plugins or tags. In the spirit of
      transparency, this policy provides detailed information about how and when we use these technologies.

    </p>
    <p>
      By continuing to visit or use our Services, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and similar technologies for
      the purposes described in this policy.

    </p>
    <p>
      What technologies are used?

    </p>
    <p>
      Cookies

    </p>
    <p>
      A cookie is a small file placed onto your device that enables share-cv features and functionality. Any browser
      visiting our sites may receive cookies from us or cookies from third parties such as our customers, partners or
      service providers. We or third parties may also place cookies in your browser when you visit non-share-cv sites
      that display ads or that host our plugins or tags.

    </p>
    <p>
      We use two types of cookies: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie lasts beyond the current
      session and is used for many purposes, such as recognizing you as an existing user, so it’s easier to return to
      share-cv and interact with our Services without signing in again. Since a persistent cookie stays in your browser,
      it will be read by share-cv when you return to one of our sites or visit a third party site that uses our
      Services. Session cookies last only as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser
      session).

    </p>
    <p>
      Pixels

    </p>
    <p>
      A pixel is a tiny image that may be embedded within web pages and emails, requiring a call (which provides device
      and visit information) to our servers in order for the pixel to be rendered in those web pages and emails. We use
      pixels to learn more about your interactions with email content or web content, such as whether you interacted
      with ads or posts. Pixels can also enable us and third parties to place cookies on your browser.

    </p>
    <p>
      Local storage

    </p>
    <p>
      Local storage enables a website or application to store information locally on your device(s). Local storage may
      be used to improve the share-cv experience, for example, by enabling features, remembering your preferences and
      speeding up site functionality.

    </p>
    <p>
      Other similar technologies

    </p>
    <p>
      We also use other tracking technologies, such as mobile advertising IDs and tags for similar purposes as described
      in this Cookie Policy. References to similar technologies in this policy includes pixels, local storage, and other
      tracking technologies.

    </p>
    <p>
      What are these technologies used for?

    </p>
    <p>
      Below we describe the purposes for which we use these technologies.

    </p>
    <p>
      Authentication

    </p>
    <p>
      We use cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our Services.

    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re signed into share-cv, these technologies help us show you the right information and personalize your
      experience in line with your settings. For example, cookies enable share-cv to identify you and verify your
      account.

    </p>
    <p>
      Security

    </p>
    <p>
      We use cookies and similar technologies to make your interactions with our Services faster and more secure.

    </p>
    <p>
      For example, we use cookies to enable and support our security features, keep your account safe and to help us
      detect malicious activity and violations of our User Agreement.

    </p>
    <p>
      Preferences, features and services

    </p>
    <p>
      We use cookies and similar technologies to enable the functionality of our Services, such as helping you to fill
      out forms on our Services more easily and providing you with features, insights and customized content in
      conjunction with our plugins. We also use these technologies to remember information about your browser and your
      preferences.

    </p>
    <p>
      For example, cookies can tell us which language you prefer and what your communications preferences are. We may
      also use local storage to speed up site functionality.

    </p>
    <p>
      Customized content

    </p>
    <p>
      We use cookies and similar technologies to customize your experience on our Services.

    </p>
    <p>
      For example, we may use cookies to remember previous searches so that when you return to our services, we can
      offer additional information that relates to your previous search.
