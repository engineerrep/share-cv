    <p class="txt">
      You agree that by clicking "Join Now", "Join Share-CV", "Sign Up" or similar, registering, accessing or using
      our services (described below), you are agreeing to enter into a legally binding contract with Share-CV (even if
      you are using our Services on behalf of a company). If you do not agree to this contract ("Contract" or "User
      Agreement"), do not click "Join Now" (or similar) and do not access or otherwise use any of our Services. If you
      wish to terminate this contract, at any time you can do so by closing your account and no longer accessing or
      using our Services.
    </p>
    <p class=""> Services</p>
    <p> This Contract applies to Share-CV.com, Share-CV-branded apps, Share-CV Learning and other Share-CV-related
      sites,
      apps, communications and other services that state that they are offered under this Contract ("Services"),
      including the offsite collection of data for those Services, such as our ads and the "Apply with Share-CV" and
      "Share with Share-CV" plugins. Registered users of our Services are "Members" and unregistered users are
      "Visitors".
    </p>

    <p class=""> Share-CV</p>
    <p>
      You are entering into this Contract with Share-CV (also referred to as "we" and "us").
    </p>
    <p> We use the term "Designated Countries" to refer to countries in the European Union (EU), European Economic
      Area
      (EEA), and Switzerland.
    </p>

    <p> You will sign this contract with Yisheng Network Technology Co., LTD (" Yisheng Network). Yisheng Network
      will be
      the controlling party. Control your personal data provided to us, collected by or for the purposes of our
      Services, or processed by us for our Services.
    </p>

    <p>As a Visitor or Member of our Services, the collection, use and sharing of your personal data is subject to
      this
      Privacy Policy (which includes our Cookie Policy and other documents referenced in this Privacy Policy) and
      updates.
    </p>

    <div> 1.2 Members and Visitors</div>
    <div> When you register and join the Share-CV Services, you become a Member. If you have chosen not to register
      for our
      Services, you may access certain features as a "Visitor."
    </div>

    <div> 1.3 Change</div>
    <div> We may modify this Contract, our Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy from time to time. If we make
      material
      changes to it, we will provide you notice through our Services, or by other means, to provide you the
      opportunity
      to review the changes before they become effective. We agree that changes cannot be retroactive. If you object
      to
      any changes, you may close your account. Your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice
      about our changes to these terms means that you are consenting to the updated terms as of their effective date.
    </div>

    <div>2. Obligations</div>
    <div> 2.1 Service Eligibility</div>
    <div>
      The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16.
    </div>
    <div>To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the "Minimum Age"(described below) or older; (2) you
      will
      only have one Share-CV account, which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by
      Share-CV from using the Services. Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms,
      including accounts registered on behalf of others or persons under the age of 16.
    </div>

    <div> "Minimum Age" means 16 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for Share-CV to
      lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using of your personal data) then the
      Minimum Age is such older age.
    </div>

    <div>2.2 Your Account</div>
    <div> Members are account holders. You agree to: (1) use a strong password and keep it confidential; (2) not
      transfer
      any part of your account (e.g., connections) and (3) follow the law and our list of Dos and Don’ts and
      Professional Community Policies. You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you
      close it or report misuse.
    </div>

    <div> As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs to you. However, if the Services
      were
      purchased by another party for you to use (e.g. Recruiter seat bought by your employer), the party paying for
      such
      Service has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do
      not
      have rights to your personal account
    </div>

    <div>2.3 Payment</div>
    <div> If you buy any of our paid Services ("Premium Services"), you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes
      and to
      additional terms specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your
      paid Services. Also, you agree that:
    </div>

    <div> Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g.
      exchange
      rates).
    </div>
    <div> We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g. credit card) even after it has expired, to avoid
      interruptions in your Services and to use to pay other Services you may buy.
      If you purchase a subscription, your payment method automatically will be charged at the start of each
      subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the
      renewal date. Learn how to cancel or suspend your Premium Services.
      All of your purchases of Services are subject to Share-CV’s refund policy.
      We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us at the time of
      purchase.
      You can get a copy of your invoice through your Share-CV account settings under "Purchase History".
    </div>

    <div> 2.4 Sharing</div>
    <div> Our Services allow messaging and sharing of information in many ways, such as your profile, articles, group
      posts,
      links to news articles, job postings, messages and InMails. Information and content that you share or post may
      be
      seen by other Members, Visitors or others (including off of the Services). Where we have made settings
      available,
      we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or information (e.g., message content to your
      addressees, sharing content only to Share-CV connections, restricting your profile visibility from search
      engines,
      or opting not to notify others of your Share-CV profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not
      notifying your connections network or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Service or opt to
      signal
      that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster.
    </div>

    <div> We are not obligated to publish any information or content on our Service and can remove it with or without
      notice.
    </div>

    <div>3. Rights and Limits</div>
    <div>3.1. Your License to Share-CV</div>
    <div> As between you and Share-CV, you own the content and information that you submit or post to the Services,
      and you
      are only granting Share-CV and our affiliates the following non-exclusive license:
    </div>

    <div> A worldwide, transferable and sublicensable right to use, copy, modify, distribute, publish and process,
      information and content that you provide through our Services and the services of others, without any further
      consent, notice and/or compensation to you or others. These rights are limited in the following ways:
    </div>

    <p> You can end this license for specific content by deleting such content from the Services, or generally by
      closing
      your account, except (a) to the extent you shared it with others as part of the Service and they copied,
      re-shared
      it or stored it and (b) for the reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other systems.</p>
    <p> We will not include your content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others
      without your separate consent (including sponsored content). However, we have the right, without payment to you
      or
      others, to serve ads near your content and information, and your social actions may be visible and included with
      ads, as noted in the Privacy Policy. If you use a Service feature, we may mention that with your name or photo
      to
      promote that feature within our Services, subject to your settings.</p>
    <p> We will get your consent if we want to give others the right to publish your content beyond the Services.
      However,
      if you choose to share your post as "public, everyone or similar", we will enable a feature that allows other
      Members to embed that public post onto third-party services, and we enable search engines to make that public
      content findable though their services.</p>
    <p> While we may edit and make format changes to your content (such as translating or transcribing it, modifying
      the
      size, layout or file type or removing metadata), we will not modify the meaning of your expression.
      Because you own your content and information and we only have non-exclusive rights to it, you may choose to make
      it available to others, including under the terms of a Creative Commons license.</p>

    <p> You and Share-CV agree that we may access, store, process and use any information and personal data that you
      provide in accordance with, the terms of the Privacy Policy and your choices (including settings).</p>

    <p> By submitting suggestions or other feedback regarding our Services to Share-CV, you agree that Share-CV can
      use
      and share (but does not have to) such feedback for any purpose without compensation to you.</p>

    <p>You agree to only provide content or information that does not violate the law nor anyone’s rights (including
      intellectual property rights). You also agree that your profile information will be truthful. Share-CV may be
      required by law to remove certain information or content in certain countries.</p>

    <p> 3.2 Service Availability</p>
    <p> We may change, suspend or discontinue any of our Services. We may also modify our prices effective
      prospectively
      upon reasonable notice to the extent allowed under the law.</p>

    <p> We don’t promise to store or keep showing any information and content that you’ve posted. Share-CV is not a
      storage service. You agree that we have no obligation to store, maintain or provide you a copy of any content or
      information that you or others provide, except to the extent required by applicable law and as noted in our
      Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>3.3 Other Content, Sites and Apps</p>
    <p> By using the Services, you may encounter content or information that might be inaccurate, incomplete, delayed,
      misleading, illegal, offensive or otherwise harmful. Share-CV generally does not review content provided by our
      Members or others. You agree that we are not responsible for others’ (including other Members’) content or
      information. We cannot always prevent this misuse of our Services, and you agree that we are not responsible for
      any such misuse. You also acknowledge the risk that you or your organization may be mistakenly associated with
      content about others when we let connections and followers know you or your organization were mentioned in the
      news. Members have choices about this feature.</p>

    <p> Share-CV may help connect Members offering their services (career coaching, accounting, etc.) with Members
      seeking
      services. Share-CV does not perform nor employs individuals to perform these services. You must be at least 18
      years of age to offer, perform or procure these services. You acknowledge that Share-CV does not supervise,
      direct, control or monitor Members in the performance of these services and agree that (1) Share-CV is not
      responsible for the offering, performance or procurement of these services, (2) Share-CV does not endorse any
      particular Member’s offered services, and (3) nothing shall create an employment, agency, or joint venture
      relationship between Share-CV and any Member offering services. If you are a Member offering services, you
      represent and warrant that you have all the required licenses and will provide services consistent with our
      Professional Community Policies.</p>

    <p>Similarly, Share-CV may help you register for and/or attend events organized by Members and connect with other
      Members who are attendees at such events. You agree that (1) Share-CV is not responsible for the conduct of any
      of
      the Members or other attendees at such events, (2) Share-CV does not endorse any particular event listed on our
      Services, (3) Share-CV does not review and/or vet any of these events, and (4) that you will adhere to these
      terms
      and conditions that apply to such events.</p>

    <p> 3.4 Limits</p>
    <p>Share-CV reserves the right to limit your use of the Services, including the number of your connections and
      your
      ability to contact other Members. Share-CV reserves the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate your account if
      you breach this Contract or the law or are misusing the Services (e.g., violating any of the Dos and Don’ts or
      Professional Community Policies).</p>

    <p> 3.5 Intellectual Property Rights</p>
    <p> Share-CV reserves all of its intellectual property rights in the Services. Trademarks and logos used in
      connection
      with the Services are the trademarks of their respective owners. Share-CV, and "in" logos and other Share-CV
      trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used for our Services are trademarks or registered trademarks of
      Share-CV.</p>

    <p> 3.6 Automated Processing</p>
    <p> We use the information and data that you provide and that we have about Members to make recommendations for
      connections, content and features that may be useful to you. For example, we use data and information about you
      to
      recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters. Keeping your profile accurate and up to date helps us to make these
      recommendations more accurate and relevant.</p>

    <p> 4. Disclaimer and Limit of Liability</p>
    <p>4.1 No Warranty</p>
    <p> Share-CV AND ITS AFFILIATES MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY ABOUT THE SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY
      REPRESENTATION
      THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, AND PROVIDE THE SERVICES (INCLUDING CONTENT AND
      INFORMATION) ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW,
      Share-CV AND ITS AFFILIATES DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTY, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF TITLE,
      ACCURACY OF DATA, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p>

    <p> 4.2 Exclusion of Liability</p>
    <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW (AND UNLESS Share-CV HAS ENTERED INTO A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT THAT
      OVERRIDES THIS CONTRACT), Share-CV, INCLUDING ITS AFFILIATES, WILL NOT BE LIABLE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
      CONTRACT
      FOR LOST PROFITS OR LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, REPUTATION (E.G., OFFENSIVE OR DEFAMATORY STATEMENTS), LOSS OF
      DATA (E.G., DOWN TIME OR LOSS, USE OF, OR CHANGES TO, YOUR INFORMATION OR CONTENT) OR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
      CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.</p>

    <p> Share-CV AND ITS AFFILIATES WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THIS CONTRACT FOR ANY AMOUNT THAT
      EXCEEDS
      (A) THE TOTAL FEES PAID OR PAYABLE BY YOU TO Share-CV FOR THE SERVICES DURING THE TERM OF THIS CONTRACT, IF ANY,
      OR (B) US $1000.</p>

    <p>4.3 Basis of the Bargain; Exclusions</p>
    <p>The limitations of liability in this Section 4 are part of the basis of the bargain between you and Share-CV
      and
      shall apply to all claims of liability (e.g., warranty, tort, negligence, contract and law) even if Share-CV or
      its affiliates has been told of the possibility of any such damage, and even if these remedies fail their
      essential purpose.</p>
    <p> These limitations of liability do not apply to liability for death or personal injury or for fraud, gross
      negligence or intentional misconduct, or in cases of negligence where a material obligation has been breached, a
      material obligation being such which forms a prerequisite to our delivery of services and on which you may
      reasonably rely, but only to the extent that the damages were directly caused by the breach and were foreseeable
      upon conclusion of this Contract and to the extent that they are typical in the context of this Contract.</p>

    <p>5. Termination</p>
    <p> Both you and Share-CV may terminate this Contract at any time with notice to the other. On termination, you
      lose
      the right to access or use the Services. The following shall survive termination:</p>

    <p> Our rights to use and disclose your feedback;</p>
    <p> Members and/or Visitors’ rights to further re-share content and information you shared through the
      Services;</p>
    <p> Sections 4, 6, 7, and 8.2 of this Contract;</p>
    <p> Any amounts owed by either party prior to termination remain owed after termination.</p>
    <p> You can visit our Help Center to close your account.</p>

    <p> 6. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</p>
    <p> If you live in the Designated Countries, the laws of Ireland govern all claims related to Share-CV's provision
      of
      the Services, but this shall not deprive you of the mandatory consumer protections under the law of the country
      to
      which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence. With respect to jurisdiction, you and Share-CV
      agree to choose the courts of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence for
      all disputes arising out of or relating to this User Agreement, or in the alternative, you may choose the
      responsible court in Ireland.</p>

    <p>For others outside of Designated Countries, including those who live outside of the United States: You and
      Share-CV agree that the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of laws rules, shall
      exclusively govern any dispute relating to this Contract and/or the Services. You and Share-CV both agree that
      all
      claims and disputes can be litigated only in the federal or state courts in Santa Clara County, California, USA,
      and you and Share-CV each agree to personal jurisdiction in those courts</p>

    <p>7. General Terms</p>
    <p> If a court with authority over this Contract finds any part of it unenforceable, you and we agree that the
      court
      should modify the terms to make that part enforceable while still achieving its intent. If the court cannot do
      that, you and we agree to ask the court to remove that unenforceable part and still enforce the rest of this
      Contract.</p>

    <p> This Contract (including additional terms that may be provided by us when you engage with a feature of the
      Services) is the only agreement between us regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements for the
      Services.</p>

    <p> If we don't act to enforce a breach of this Contract, that does not mean that Share-CV has waived its right to
      enforce this Contract. You may not assign or transfer this Contract (or your membership or use of Services) to
      anyone without our consent. However, you agree that Share-CV may assign this Contract to its affiliates or a
      party
      that buys it without your consent. There are no third-party beneficiaries to this Contract.</p>

    <p> You agree that the only way to provide us legal notice is at the addresses provided in Section 10.</p>
